## Objective 
This challenge is very different from the others we've completed because it requires you to generate a valid test case for a problem instead of solving the problem. There is no input to read, you simply have to generate and print test values for the problem that satisfy both the problem's Input Format and the criteria laid out in the Task section.

## Task

Create and print a test case for the problem above that meet the following criteria:

* t <= 5
* 1 <= n <= 200
* 1 <= k <= n
* -10^3 <= a_i <=10^3
* The value of n must be distinct across all the test cases
* Array A must have at least 1 zero, 1 positive integer, and 1 negative integer

## Input Format

You are not responsible for reading anything from stdin.

## Output Format

Print 11 lines of output that can be read by the Professor challenge as valid input. Your test case must result in the following output when fed as input to the Professor challenge's solution:

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
```
