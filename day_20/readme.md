## Objective 
Today, we're learning about Interfaces.

## Task 
The AdvancedArithmetic interface and the method declaration for the abstract int divisorSum(int n) method are provided for you in the editor below. Write the Calculator class, which implements the AdvancedArithmetic interface. The implementation for the divisorSum method must be public and take an integer parameter, n, and return the sum of all its divisors.

## Input Format

A single line containing an integer, n.

## Constraints
* 1 <= n <= 1000

## Output Format

You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. The locked Solution class in the editor below will call your code and print the necessary output.

## Sample Input

```
6
```

## Sample Output

```
I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12
```
